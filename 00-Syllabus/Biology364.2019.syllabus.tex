\section{Course Description}

Introduction to the process of data exploration and visualization using
state-of-the-art computational techniques. Using ``big data'' from
public archives or their own research projects, students will learn how
to rigorously analyze and visualize complex biological datasets. Lab
will include hands-on work with R and virtual reality. No programming
experience required.
    
    
%-------------------------------------------------------
\section{Course Objectives}\label{course-objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Students will analyze, visualize, and intepret real-world
  datasets using reproducible data science methods and R, R markdown, and Git.
\item
  Students will learn to identify and avoid questionable research practices 
  when designing experiments, analyzing data, and presenting results.
\item
  Working as a team, students will complete novel projects utilizing
  whole-transcriptome or whole-genome datasets.
\item
  Students will present their final projects using complex
  multi-dimensional data visualizations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Grading}

  \begin{align*}
    Ten \, Homeworks, \, worth \, 10 \, points \, each = 100 pts.\\
    Four \, Data \, Projects, \, worth \, 25 \, points \, each = 100 pts.\\
    Takehome \, Midterm \, Exam = 100 pts.\\
    Final \, Project = 100 pts.\\
    Takehome \, Final \, Exam = 100 pts.\\
    {\bf Total = 500 pts.}
  \end{align*}

  The Data Projects and Final Project will be graded using labor-based contract grading as described by \href{http://www.translingualwriting.com/resources/Inoue\%20Contract.pdf}{Asao Inoue}. These assignments will utilize a goal-oriented grading system as you develop your skills as a data scientist.  When you or your group completes all of the goals associated with each project, you will earn 43/50 or 85/100 pts (85\%). Failure to do so will result in a lower grade.

To earn more than 85\%, you must do the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Propose and perform additional analysis and visualization comparisons (discuss available options with me).
  \item Routinely assist in the learning and proficiency of your peers.
\end{itemize}


\section{Textbooks and Readings}

    Your attendance at all classes and lab is expected, but not a graded part of the course. If you will need to miss lab for any reason, contact Prof. Field before class to make arrangements.
  
  \subsection{Readings}
  
    Readings must be done, BEFORE the class, where they are assigned. 
    The reading assignment, is for the class with which it is listed. 
  
  \subsection{Homework Assignments}
  
    Homeworks are due before noon on Friday on the week they are assigned.
    Homework assignments will be submitted on GitHub after week 1 (more instructions to follow).
    A 25\% deduction will be assessed for submissions not received by noon on Friday. Assignments will not be accepated after noon on Monday.
  
  \subsection{Collaboration and Citation}
  
    For all projects and homework assignments working together is acceptable and encouraged. 
    It is not ethical to do someone else's work or to have someone do your work. 
    You must cite \textbf{all} resources used to work on your homework and projects. 
    Citations should be done at the end of the document. 
    These references can be to books, Wikipedia and other web resources, and discussions with other students. 
    Working together and discussion is not allowed on takehome exams.
  
  \subsection{Academic Integrity Policy}
  
    Read \href{"http://www.bucknell.edu/AcademicResponsibility.xml"}{Academic Responsibility at Bucknell} for policies regarding academic integrity. Any questions concerning academic responsibility or misconduct will be referred to the Board of Review for Academic Responsibility without hesitation. Always cite the source of any information from outside sources, including online sources and classmates. Assignments may be screened using software designed to detect plaigarism. Unless explicitly directed otherwise, all takehome exams are expected to represent individual, not collaborative, work.
