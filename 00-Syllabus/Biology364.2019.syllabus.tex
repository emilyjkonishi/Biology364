\section{Joint Undergraduate and Graduate Course}

  \subsection{DSCI351 and DSCI351M}
  
    DSCI351 is the 3rd level class in the Applied Data Science UG Minor. 
    The ADS Minor is available to CWRU students across all the schools in the University. 
    For more information see  \href{''http://bulletin.case.edu/schoolofengineering/datascience/''}{http://bulletin.case.edu/schoolofengineering/datascience/}. 
    
    DSCI351 will introduce students to the basic elements of a data analysis, including R coding, Rstudio IDE and Git version control, statistical concepts, the stages of a data analysis and reproducible research. 
    
    DSCI351M section focuses specifically on Exploratory Data Science for Materials and Materials' Systems. 

  \subsection{DSCI451}
  
    DSCI 451 is a graduate level introduction to data science and analytics. 
    Graduate students will develop a 10 week data science project focused on time-series, spectral, image, statistical process control or machine learning data science problems that are relevant to their research interests. 
    These projects will include preparing datasets, code scripts and functions, a git repository for other students to use these codes as open source resources, and the preparation of reproducible data science analyses for these problems. 

\section{Course Description}

  In this course, we will learn data science and analysis approaches to identify statistically significance relationships and better model and predict the behavior of these systems. 
  We will assembly and explore real-world datasets, perform clustering and pair plot analyses to investigate correlations, and logistic regression will be employed to develop associated predictive models. 
  Results will be interpreted, visualized and discussed. 
  
  We will introduce basic elements of statistical analysis using \href{"http://cran.case.edu/"}{R Project open source software} for exploratory data analysis and model development. 
  R is an open-source software project with broad abilities to access machine-readable open-data resources, data cleaning and munging functions, and a rich selection of statistical packages, used for data analytics, model development and prediction. 
  This will include an introduction to R data types, reading and writing data, looping, plotting and regular expressions, so that one can start performing variable transformations for linear fitting and developing structural equation models, while exploring for statistically significant relationships. 
  We will also learn tidy principles for data analysis, pipes and ggplot vs base graphics approaches to data visualization. 
  
  R Analytics will be applied to the case of time-series, spectral, image and categorical datasets and problems by analyzing system responses, combined with results of experiments to identify fundamental principles that are statistically significant in the observed system performance. 
  We will learn about longitudinal and cross-sectional data science studies, along with retrospective and prospective studies. 
  
  The class will be structured to have a balance of theory and practice. 
  We'll split class into Foundation and Practicum
  	a) lectures, presentations, discussion
  	b) coding, demonstrations and live hands-on data science work. 
  
  Every student will have access to their own pre-configured Open Data Science VDI computer, already configured for fast and easy adoption of good data science practices and tools. 
  And the ODS VDIs are updated each month so as to have the latest versions of R packages and software for data science.

\section{Setting up your R data science computer}

If you do want to install the softwares on your personal computer, here's how.

  \subsection{For Windows}
  
  In Windows we are allowed to use spaces in filenames, however, most other systems does not support that. 
  To avoid conflicts or troubles, we suggest using \href{https://sanaulla.info/2008/06/25/camelcase-notation-naming-convention-for-programming-languages/}{camelBack} naming convention or use "-" or "\_" to replace spaces. 
  
    \subsubsection{LaTeX}
    
      \LaTeX~is a document preparation system that is widely used in the academia for producing scientific documents. 
      You will need to install two softwares,  Miktex and TeXstudio. \\
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Download and run the Basic MiKTeX Installer. 
        MiKTeX has the ability to install missing packages automatically, i.e., this installer is suitable for computers connected to the Internet. 
        Before you run the installer, you can check the \href{https://miktex.org/kb/prerequisites-2-9}{prerequisites}. 
        The installer is available on the \href{https://miktex.org/download}{download} page. 
        You start it with a double-click on the downloaded file. 
        \item Read the Copying Conditions carefully and click "I accept the MiKTeX copying conditions", the click "Next", as demonstrated below. 
        
        \begin{figure}[!ht]

          \caption{}
          \label{fig:basic-miktex-license-2-9}
        \end{figure}
        \item You have the Option to create a shared MiKTeX installation. 
        Click "Anyone who uses this Computer (all users), if you want to install MiKTeX for all users. 
        Click "Only for ...", if you want to install MiKTeX for yourself only. 
        When you have made your decision, click "Next" to go to the next page. 
        
        \begin{figure}[h]

        \end{figure}
        \pagebreak
        \item The installer allows you to set the preferred paper size(usually it's A4 in China and letter size in the US). 
        You also have the option to change the default behavior of the integrated package manager for the case where a required package is missing. 
        Select "Yes", to make the package manager is always allowed to install missing packages. 
        All these configurations can be changed later.

        libtiff5-dev fftw3 fftw3-dev  tmux libav-tools
        cifs-utils openssh-server openssh-client tree htop
        gdebi curl libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev
        \end{lstlisting}
        \item Before installing, you should \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{check the latest version} of RStudio, and change the version number in the code below accordingly. 
        Install RStudio:

        ## Update to the latest version number in the lines below
        wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-1.1.383-amd64.deb
        sudo gdebi -n rstudio-1.1.383-amd64.deb
        rm rstudio-1.1.383-amd64.deb
        \end{lstlisting}
        
      \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{For Mac}
  
    \subsubsection{Homebrew}

      To install Homebrew, paste and run the following command in terminal:
      \begin{lstlisting}
      /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/
      install/master/install)"
      \end{lstlisting}
      You can read more about Homebrew \href{https://brew.sh/}{here}. 
      
    \subsubsection{XQuartz}
    
      To correctly set up your linux environment, you should also install XQuartz. 
      XQuartz is Apple Inc.'s version of the X server, a component of the X Window System for macOS. 
      You can \href{https://www.xquartz.org/}{download} and install the latest version of XQuartz. 
      
    \subsubsection{LaTeX}
    
      To install LaTeX on Mac, you need to install MacTeX and TeXstudio. 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The current distribution as of today (\today)is MacTeX-2017. 
        This distribution requires Mac OS 10.10, Yosemite, or higher and runs on Intel processors. 
        To download, click \href{http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html}{MacTeX Download}. 
        \item After downloading, double click on the MacTeX.pkg to install. 
        Follow the straightforward instructions. 
        Installation on a recent Macintosh takes four to six minutes. 
        \item At the end of installation, the installer will report "Success." But sometimes, the installer puts up a dialog saying "Verifying..." and then the install hangs. 
        In all cases known to us, rebooting the Macintosh fixes this problem. 
        After the reboot, install again. 
        \item Now you can start installing TeXstudio. 
        You can find the corresponding installer on the \href{https://www.texstudio.org/}{TeXstudio website}. 
        \item Because the developers of TeXstudio do not have an Apple Developer Account, OS X may complain about an unidentified developer and deny opening TXS. 
        In that case, open the context menu on the TXS icon (Ctrl + Click) and select open. 
      \end{itemize} 
    
    \subsubsection{Git}
    
      There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. 
      In fact, if you've installed XCode (or it's Command Line Tools), Git may already be installed. 
      To find out, open a terminal and enter git --version. 
      
      Apple actually maintain and ship their own fork of Git, but it tends to lag behind mainstream Git by several major versions. 
      You may want to install a newer version of Git using the method below:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Download the latest Git for \href{https://git-scm.com/download/mac}{Mac installer}. 
        \item Follow the prompts to install Git. 
        \item Open a terminal and verify the installation was successful by typing git --version. 
        \item Configure your Git username and email using the following commands, replacing "yourusername" with your own. 
        These details will be associated with any commits that you create:
        \begin{lstlisting}
        $ git config --global user.name "yourusername"
        $ git config --global user.email "youremail@website.com"
        \end{lstlisting}
      \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{R}
    
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Download R from \href{http://cran.us.r-project.org/}{CRAN} and click "Download R for (Mac) OS X". 
        \item Follow the instructions and install R. 
        \item Download the latest RStudio from their \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{website}. 
        Open the installer and follow the instructions. 
      \end{itemize}
