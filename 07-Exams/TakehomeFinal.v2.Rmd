# Introduction

For the takehome midterm you will have 48 hours to complete the objectives listed below. 
The deadline for submission is 8 May 2019 at 11am EST.

Date/Time started:
Date/Time completed:

You will be graded on the following criteria:

* Completion of the objectives
* Readability (tidyness) of Rmd code
* Summary of results from differential expression analysis
* Acknowledgement of resources

## Loading Libraries

Load all of your libraries in this code block. Indicate why each library is necessary.

```{r Load Libraries, include=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools"); library(devtools)
# devtools is needed to load packages from github repos

if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse"); library(tidyverse)
# tidyverse is needed for ggplot2, readr, and dplyr
# Always load tidyverse last so that its functions will not get masked by other packages
```

## Objectives for Final Exam

* [ ] Checking downloaded data for accuracy
* [ ] Manipulate metadata to produce files required to run SARTools
* [ ] Examination of batch effect caused by sex
* [ ] Determination of differential expression caused by treatment
* [ ] Answering questions about best practices for data analysis

## Background

RNA-Seq performed by:
Frahm KA, Waldman JK, Luthra S, Rudine AC, Monaghan-Nichols AP, Chandran UR. A comparison of the sexually dimorphic dexamethasone transcriptome in mouse cerebral cortical and hypothalamic embryonic neural stem cells. Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.05.026.

Abstract
Fetal exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids reprograms distinct neural circuits in the developing brain, often in a sex-specific manner, via mechanisms that remain poorly understood. To reveal whether such reprogramming is associated with select molecular signatures, we characterized the transcriptome of primary, embryonic mouse cerebral cortical and hypothalamic neural progenitor/stem cells derived from individual male and female embryos exposed to the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. Gene expression profiling by RNA-Seq identified differential expression of common and unique genes based upon brain region, sex, and/or dexamethasone exposure. These gene expression datasets provide a unique resource that will inform future studies examining the molecular mechanisms responsible for region- and sex-specific reprogramming of the fetal brain brought about by in utero exposure to excess glucocorticoids.

Dataset download:
The full dataset is available from: https://figshare.com/articles/kallisto_quantifications_of_Frahm_et_al_2017/6203012

The raw reads are available from the Sequence Read Archive, although we will not be using them for the take-home exam:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRP100701

Kallisto has already been used to quantify transcripts and we will only be analyzing the samples from the hypothalamus.

The Kallisto results have has been placed in a Zip file in the class repo in the 07-Exams directory. 
Download the file SRP100701.zip, move it to your repo, and then unzip the file. 
You can then delete the .zip file so that it will not also be pushed to your repo.

```{r Read Metadata}
sample_table <- read_tsv("SRP100701.sample_table.txt")
sample_table
```

## SARTools

The SARTools package has been developped at PF2 - Institut Pasteur by M.-A. Dillies and H. Varet. *SARTools: A DESeq2- and EdgeR-Based R Pipeline for Comprehensive Differential Analysis of RNA-Seq Data*, PLoS One, 2016, doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157022

Help for SARTools can be found at https://github.com/PF2-pasteur-fr/SARTools

# Takehome Final Part 1

As a reminder, you may consult your previous homework and group projects, textbook and other readings, and online resources.
Online resources may be used to research ways to solve each problem, but you may not pose questions in online forums about the specific assignment.
You may consult with Prof. Field or with other classmates about technical problems (e.g. where to find a file), but not about how to answer any of the questions.

## (1) Data Verification

### Check the metadata

Check the gender, treatment, and tissue values in your metadata table against either the original paper or the SRA.
Verify that the file names in the kallisto results folder match run names in the metadata.

### Check the kallisto count data

Load in at least two of the abundance.tsv files.
Look at the top and the bottom of your data. (Note which column has the estimated counts for later.)
Verify that both files have the same number of transcripts.
Confirm that there are no NAs present.


## (2) Run SARTools

Use DESeq2 for your analysis (although you are welcome to compare the results to edgeR).
Use an FDR cutoff of 0.05 to determine differential expression (and also leave other settings in SARTools at their default values).

### Use dplyr to construct the target.txt file that you need for SARTools, starting from SRP100701.sample_table.txt

You will need to retain only the hypothalamus samples. 
Keep the sample name, sex, and treatment.
Save this file as a tsv so that you can use it in SARTools.

### Sex-differences in transcript expression

First look to see if there are major differences in gene expression based on sex.
Adapt the SARTools script from the RNASeqProject to analyze transcript-level differential expression. 
Do not include the R script in this Markdown, instead provide a link to it and run it separately: [R script](script.R).
Link to the final report in this file [SARTools Report](reports/DESeq2_report.html).

### Treatment effects on transcript expression

Use batch to correct for sex-differences and then look for transcripts that are differentially expressed based on dexamethasone treatment.

## (3) Summarize your differential expression analysis

Your advisor wants to know whether you found any effect of treatment. 
Provide a concise summary of your analysis, including up to 3 figures from your SARTools analysis.

```{r Example figure}
knitr::include_graphics("../09-FinalProject/results/figures/fig1.png")
```


# Takehome Final Part 2

If you are unable to complete Part 1 of the exam, then you will need to submit it to your repo as TakehomeFinal.Incomplete.Rmd.
At that point, you will need to @KField-Bucknell in an issue to request access to the files that you need. 
I will be granting access to the files up until 9am on May 8th.

## Q1: Comparison to previous analysis

You would like to know if your results are consistent with those described in the Frahm et al. paper. [Frahm et al.](Frahm_etal.pdf)
You do not have to carry out the comparison, but briefly describe (3-4 sentences) the process that you would need to follow to answer this (simple) question.

## Q2: Improvements to Frahm et al.

Imagine that you are reviewing a draft of this manuscript prior to submitting it for publication. 
Describe the 3 most important suggestions that would incorporate best practices in data analysis and visualization.

### Suggestion 1:



### Suggestion 2:



### Suggestion 3:




## Q3: Research Practices

Imagine that you conducted this analysis for your Honors/Masters thesis project. 
Describe how you would handle each of the following scenarios, citing specific QRPs where appropriate.

### Scenario 1:
You are concerned that two of the samples may have been switched during sample preparation. 
What is your confidence that this did or did not occur?



### Scenario 2:
Your advisor is disappointed with the number of differentially expressed transcripts that you found in the female vs male comparison.
They suggest that you should send additional samples out for sequencing and add them to this study to increase the statistical power.



### Scenario 3:
The transcripts that are differentially expressed between vehicle and dexamethasone treated cells does not include several that had been found in a previous study in your lab. 
Your advisor suggests re-running the analysis using the model counts ~ sex * treatment instead of the model counts ~ sex + treatment.
(Note that SARTools cannot handle GLM interactions and this would have to be done with DESeq2 in R.)
