Chapter 1: Introduction to Data
========================================================

### Explanatory and Response Variables

- To identify the explanatory variable in a pair of variables, identify which of the two is suspected of affecting the other:

*explanatory variable* ---------> *response variable*

Labeling variables as explanatory and response does not guarantee the relationship between the two is actually causal, even if there is an association identified between the two variables. We use these labels only to keep track of which variable we suspect affects the other.

**Observational study**: Researchers collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise, i.e. they merely "observe", and can only establish an association between the explanatory and response variables.

**Experiment**: Researchers randomly assign subjects to various treatments in order to establish causal connections between the explanatory and response variables.

Application
========================================================

What is the main difference between observational studies and experiments?

1. Experiments take place in a lab while observational studies do not need to.
2. In an observational study we only look at what happened in the past.
3. Most experiments use random assignment while observational studies do not.
4. Observational studies are completely useless since no causal inference can be made based on their findings.

Principles of experimental design
========================================================

1. **Control**: Compare treatment of interest to a control group. 
2. **Randomize**: Randomly assign subjects to treatments, and randomly sample from the population whenever possible.
3. **Replicate**: Within a study, replicate by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Or replicate the entire study.
4. **Block**: If there are variables that are known or suspected to affect the response variable, first group subjects into blocks based on these variables, and then randomize cases within each block to treatment groups.

Application
========================================================

A study is designed to test the effect of light level and noise level on exam performance of students. The researcher also believes that light and noise levels might have different effects on males and females, so wants to make sure both genders are equally represented in each group. Which of the below is correct?

1. There are 3 explanatory variables (light, noise, gender) and 1 response variable (exam performance)
2. There are 2 explanatory variables (light and noise), 1 blocking variable (gender), and 1 response variable (exam performance)
3. There is 1 explanatory variable (gender) and 3 response variables (light, noise, exam performance)
4. There are 2 blocking variables (light and noise), 1 explanatory variable (gender), and 1 response variable (exam performance)

Chapter 2: Probability
========================================================

**Independence**

if P(A | B) = P(A) then the events A and B are said to be independent.

Conceptually: Giving B doesn’t tell us anything about A.

Application
========================================================

Consider the following (hypothetical) distribution of gender and major of students in an introductory statistics class:

|      |Social Science|not Social Science|Total|
|------|--------------|------------------|-----|
|male  |    30        |    20            |50   |
|female|    30        |    20            |50   |
|Total |    60        |    40            |100  |

Is Gender independent of major?

Chapter 3: Distributions of Random Variables
========================================================

**Normal Distributions**

*68-95-99.7 Rule* 

For nearly normally distributed data,

- about 68% falls within 1 SD of the mean,

- about 95% falls within 2 SD of the mean,

- about 99.7% falls within 3 SD of the mean.

It is possible for observations to fall 4, 5, or more standard deviations away from the mean, but these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal.
