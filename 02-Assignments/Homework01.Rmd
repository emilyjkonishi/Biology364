## Sleep Dataset

 <https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.bucknell.edu/science/article/pii/S2352721818301190#!>.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
