```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading Libraries

Be sure to annotate all of your code with comments that describe the purpose.
If the annotation is true for a whole code chunk, leave it outside of the code chunk. 
If it only applies to a single line, use comments within the code chunk.

```{r Load Libraries, include=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools"); library(devtools) # Only needed if you will be loading packages from github

#Load last:
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse"); library(tidyverse) # Loads ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr and others
```

## Guidelines

This suggested template is optional. You may use different organization if it is better for your project.

### Expectations

1. Identify and upload a suitable "big data" dataset.
2. Use data wrangling to verify the data quality and document data exploration.
3. Design a data analysis plan that avoids any questionable research practices.
4. Use appropriate bioinformatics and data visualization tools to analyze the data.
5. Use the guidelines from the British Ecological Society to produce a reproducible research report.
6. Explore interactive visualizations.
7. Summarize your analysis and results in an oral presentation.
8. Incorporate feedback from your peers to produce a final report.

### Suggested directory structure

Adapted from [https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-init]

```
project
|- data            # raw and primary data, are not changed once created 
|  |- raw/         # raw data, will not be altered
|  +- clean/       # cleaned data, will not be altered once created
|
|- code/           # any programmatic code
|- results         # all output from workflows and analyses
|  |- figures/     # graphs
|  +- tables/      # tables
|
|- scratch/        # temporary files that can be safely deleted or lost
|- README          # the top level description of content
|- preanalysis.Rmd # the preanalysis document
|- study.Rmd       # executable Rmarkdown for this study, if applicable
|- study.Rproj     # RStudio project for this study, if applicable
```

## Background

Summarize the dataset and the reason for the analysis. 
Provide links to sources of the data. 
Provide citations to papers, including DOI links in the format: [Prof. Field's Science paper](https://www.doi.org/10.1126/science.aar2038)

## Pre-analysis

Provide a link to the [Preanalysis document](./preanalysis.Rmd)

## Analysis

Follow the guidelines used throughout the semester about Confirmatory vs. Exploratory data analysis. 
Clearly avoid any QRPs!

This section could either include R code chunks:

```{r Unique name}

```

Bash code chunks:

```{bash A different name}

```

or links to [R scripts](script.R),

Annotate the purpose of each section of code.

## Results

Provide a summary of your key results and interpretations. 

Figures generated outside of the Rmd can be inserted as [links](./results/figures/fig1.png) 

or as code chunks:
```{r figure 1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '25%'}
knitr::include_graphics("results/figures/fig1.png")
```

Tables could be inserted in the markdown:

```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

Or using Kable:
```{r table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5,, 1:5], caption = "A table caption")
```

## Conclusions

You know what goes here.
