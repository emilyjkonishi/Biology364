## Loading Data

Scientists have been asked to investigate whether jelly beans cause
acne. They enrolled 200 high school students in a study where the
control group (n=100) avoided all jellybeans for 2 months. The treatment
group (n=100) were given a free bag of jellybeans every week and were
told to consume all of them before the next week. At the end of the
study, the acne level of each participant was scored.

``` r
acne <- read.csv("acne.csv")
```

## Statistical Test

The scientists determined that there was no link between jelly beans and
acne.

``` r
t.test(Score ~ Group, data = acne)
```

    ## 
    ##  Welch Two Sample t-test
    ## 
    ## data:  Score by Group
    ## t = -0.5573, df = 190.9, p-value = 0.578
    ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  -1.7703396  0.9903396
    ## sample estimates:
    ##    mean in group control mean in group jellybeans 
    ##                     9.93                    10.32

``` r
ggplot(acne, aes(x=Group, y=Score)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

But people are skeptical and think that it might not be all jellybeans,
but only those of a certain color. So the scientists stop playing
Minecraft long enough to conduct a second study. This time they have a
control group (n=10) and twenty groups (n=10 per group) that each eat
bags of only a single color of jellybean.

``` r
acne2 <- read.csv("acne2.csv")

## Behind the numbers

Both acne datasets were generated using a random normal distribution.

``` r
acne <- data.frame(round(rnorm(200,10,5)))
names(acne) = c("Score")
acne$Group <- c(rep("control", each=100), rep("jellybeans", each=100))

jellybeans = c("control","purple","brown","pink","blue","teal",
               "salmon","red","turquoise","magenta","yellow",
               "grey","tan","cyan","mauve","beige",
               "green","lilac","black","peach","orange")

acne2 <- data.frame(round(rnorm(210,10,5)))
names(acne2) = c("Score")
acne2$Color <- c(rep(jellybeans, each=10))
```
